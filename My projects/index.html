                <p class="card__text" >My love and passion for computer motivated me to go in for this program and bootcamp. I use to wonder why computer seems magical, and very important. I also desired to know how devices are connect to each other regardless of
                  the distance without  visible cables.I believed computer science and software Engineering
                  will answer questions. I am so happy that I will be able to build a website for businesses
                  and organization, when I employment.
